# Healio

Our project for the Informatics Capstone is the design and development of a more accessible patient portal that is specifically geared towards families and older adults. By addressing usability issues from current solutions in our project, we aim to achieve a higher engagement rate where users from those demographics can easily view and track their medical health information on a daily basis. By regularly using our portal, these users will therefore be better equipped to manage their medical conditions.

## Build and Deploy

- Run `npm i` in the client directory
- Run `npm run start` in the client directory
- Run `node ./bin/www` in the server directory to start server
